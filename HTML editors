***********Write HTML Using Notepad or TextEdit***********

Web pages can be created and modified by using professional HTML editors.

However, for learning HTML we recommend a simple text editor like Notepad (PC) or TextEdit (Mac).

We believe using a simple text editor is a good way to learn HTML.

Follow the steps below to create your first web page with Notepad or TextEdit.

Step 1: Open Notepad (PC)
Windows 8 or later:

Open the Start Screen (the window symbol at the bottom left on your screen). Type Notepad.

***********Windows 7 or earlier***********

Open Start > Programs > Accessories > Notepad

***********Step 1: Open TextEdit (Mac***********
Open Finder > Applications > TextEdit

Also change some preferences to get the application to save files correctly. In Preferences > Format > choose "Plain Text"

Then under "Open and Save", check the box that says "Display HTML files as HTML code instead of formatted text".

Then open a new document to place the code.

***********Step 2: Write Some HTML***********
Write or copy some HTML into Notepad.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>

<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>

***********Step 3: Save the HTML Page***********
Save the file on your computer. Select File > Save as in the Notepad menu.

Name the file "index.htm" and set the encoding to UTF-8 (which is the preferred encoding for HTML files).

***********Step 4: View the HTML Page in Your Browser***********
Open the saved HTML file in your favorite browser (double click on the file, or right-click - and choose "Open with").
